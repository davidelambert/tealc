#tenscalc

tenscalc is a stringed instrument tension calculator with arguments for string material, pitch, and instrument scale length. Tension estimates for various string materials are modelled on published tension guides from a common US-based string manufacturer. Fuller details on tension coefficient modelling are available in the `modelling/` directory.
